This simulator emulates the operation of a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC). To start using the simulator and execute instructions, you can launch the "csaJar.jar" file found in the project's root directory. You have two options for running the file: you can either double-click it directly, or you can use the terminal. If you choose the terminal method, navigate to the project directory using the "cd" command, and then execute the command "java -jar run.jar."
