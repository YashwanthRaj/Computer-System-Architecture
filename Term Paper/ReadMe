In today's computing world, programs and operating systems cannot exist without effective memory management, especially if the application must operate under Survey load for an indefinite period. To improve performance, resources must be used efficiently. This paper addresses memory management in an operating system and demonstrates the basic architecture of segmentation in an operating system as well as the basics of its allocation. Memory management is one of the key roles of the operating system, which is accomplished through the usage of the memory management unit (MMU). The MMU is a software component of the operating system that lives in the kernel. The operating system manages both primary and secondary memory. This paper also describes the basic concepts of virtual memory management and dynamic memory management. Virtual memory is a notion that provides a vast addressable region to programs to facilitate multiprogramming. This suggests that the processor functions under the guise of accessing a huge accessible storage space. As a result, the operating system guarantees that available memory is managed properly and effectively to maximize system efficiency. To achieve the overall memory management goal, the operating system takes on a supervisory role via the memory manager.
